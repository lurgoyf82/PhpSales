# PhpSales
This project is a simple PHP example that calculates sales taxes for shopping carts.
It contains basic entity classes for items and a cart, along with services for parsing
input lines, calculating taxes and formatting the output.

## Requirements

* PHP 8 or later
* No additional libraries are required

## Install

Clone this repository and ensure PHP is available in your environment. There is no
`composer.json`, so there are no extra packages to install.

## Run the example

Execute the following command from the project root:

```bash
php public/index.php
```

The script will parse the builtâ€‘in arrays in `public/index.php` and print the
calculated totals and taxes.
